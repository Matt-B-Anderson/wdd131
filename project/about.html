            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="./images/whan-icon.webp" alt="woodland-hills-accounting-needs-logo">
            <p>Woodland Hills Accounting Needs (WHAN) began as a small home office in 2003 with a single goal — to help local families
            and small businesses in Woodland Hills navigate their finances with confidence. Founded by a former corporate accountant
            turned community advocate, WHAN quickly gained a reputation for honesty, transparency, and attention to detail.
            
            As the demand for personalized accounting services grew, so did we. By 2008, WHAN had opened its first office space,
            expanded its service offerings, and welcomed a team of passionate professionals dedicated to simplifying the
            complexities of finance. Over the years, we’ve embraced new technologies, adapted to ever-changing tax laws, and
            remained committed to offering the same client-first service that started it all.
            
            Today, WHAN proudly serves clients across the region, from independent contractors and start-ups to established
            businesses seeking long-term financial guidance. Our history is built on trust, growth, and a belief that good
            accounting should empower—not overwhelm—you.</p>

            <img src="images/ceo.webp" alt="CEO">
            <p>John Doe – Founder & CEO</p>
            <p>John Doe brings over 25 years of accounting experience to his role as CEO of Woodland Hills Accounting Needs
            (WHAN). With a background in corporate finance and small business consulting, Daniel founded WHAN in 2003 with a vision
            to provide accessible, trustworthy accounting services tailored to the needs of the local community.
            
            A licensed CPA and graduate of the University of Southern California, Daniel is known for his hands-on leadership style,
            strong ethical foundation, and a passion for helping clients succeed. He believes that great accounting goes beyond
            numbers — it's about building long-term relationships and providing clients with the clarity and confidence to make
            informed decisions.
            
            When he’s not in the office, Daniel enjoys hiking the trails of Woodland Hills, mentoring young entrepreneurs, and
            spending time with his wife and two kids.</p>
